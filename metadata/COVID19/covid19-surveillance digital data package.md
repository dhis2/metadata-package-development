# COVID-19 Surveillance Digital Data Package

DHIS2 has released a digital data package to accelerate case detection, situation reporting, active surveillance and response for COVID-19. The package is inspired by the Ministry of Health Sri Lanka’s pioneering design of DHIS2 tracker for COVID-19 case detection and draws on years of collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to develop information system standards for case-based disease surveillance. The COVID-19 digital data package includes standard metadata aligned with the WHO’s [technical guidance on COVID-19 surveillance and case definitions](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions) and implementation guidance to enable rapid deployment in countries.

DHIS2 is currently being used for COVID-19 Surveillance in countries around the world. Explore the map below to see where the DHIS2 COVID-19 Packages are being tested and deployed..

## What can the DHIS2 COVID-19 Surveillance Package be used for?

The package supports surveillance workflows and automated analysis for key components of routine and active surveillance:

* **COVID-19 Case-based surveillance [tracker]**: enrols & tracks suspected cases; captures symptoms, demographics, risk factors & exposures; creates lab requests; links confirmed cases with contacts; and monitors patient outcomes. This package can be installed as a standalone COVID-19 package or can be integrated into a country’s existing integrated disease surveillance & response tracker.
* **Contact registration & follow-up program [tracker]**: strengthens active case detection through contact tracing activities, such as identification and follow-up of contacts of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.
* **Ports of Entry screening & follow-up program [tracker]**: enrols travellers who have visited high-risk locations at Ports of Entry for 14-day monitoring and follow-up.
* **COVID-19 Surveillance Event Program [event]**:a simplified line-list that captures a subset of minimum critical data points to facilitate rapid analysis & response, particularly useful when caseloads or burden of reporting exceeds capacity for case-based surveillance tracker
* **COVID-19 Aggregate Surveillance [aggregate]**: an aggregate reporting dataset that captures minimum necessary data points for daily or weekly reporting

All digital data packages are optimized for Android data collection with the DHIS2 Capture App, which is free to download on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhis2&hl=en).
